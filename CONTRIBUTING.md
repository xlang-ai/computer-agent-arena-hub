# Contributing to Computer Agent Arena

As you can see, the Computer Agent Arena platform is for comparing different computer agents in real-world tasks. This repo is mainly for developers who want to introduce new agents to the arena. We provide a very friendly and use-to-use framework to plugin new agents. We value every contribution, whether it's adding new agents, fixing bugs, improving documentation, or suggesting new features.
